## 💡 What I Learned

Building this project taught me:
- How to work with APIs and fetch data
- Async JavaScript (promises, .then(), .catch())
- Error handling and user feedback
- DOM manipulation
- CSS styling and animations

## 🎓 About This Project

This is my second project learning web development! It's a big step up from my first projects because it:
- Makes real API calls to external services
- Handles async operations
- Provides professional error handling
- Has a polished user interface

## 🔧 Setup (If You Want to Run It)

1. Download or clone this repository
2. Open `index.html` in your browser
3. That's it! No installation needed!

**Note:** The API key is included in the code for demo purposes. In a real production app, API keys should be kept private!

## 📝 Future Improvements

Ideas for future versions:
- Add a loading spinner while fetching data
- Show more weather details (humidity, wind speed)
- Display weather icons
- Add 5-day forecast
- Remember last searched city
- Support both Celsius and Fahrenheit
